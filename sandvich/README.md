# Use linters instead

This entire language is not useful.  

Languages designed for interpretation don't have types, declarations, constants
and other things i yearned for, for a very good reason.  

If you want to know why these things are not that useful for interpretation see
problems.md.  

If you came here out of interest in these things,
i recommend you to use linters.

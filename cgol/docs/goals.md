# Conways game of life

## Goals

This collection of source code is for comparing basic usage differences
between programming languages.  
C is the baseline for that.  
Implement a Conway's Game of Life in various languages.  
The goals are described after the C implementation and prescribe all other
implementations.

- dealing with different terminal sizes
- dynamic world sizes
- flags, options etc (args are only for init coords)
